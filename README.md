# Quantum Chaos, Fractals & Randomness Generator

This repository contains a **quantum chaos and fractal-based randomness generator** built using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).  
The code applies chaotic and fractal-inspired phase shifts on a quantum circuit, measures the output, and computes randomness metrics such as **Shannon entropy** and **fidelity**.  
It also generates **random bitstreams** and their **SHA-256 digest**, making it useful for randomness studies and cryptographic seed generation.
